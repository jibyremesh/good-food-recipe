Create two recipe-information applications. In the first application,
create a live list of recipes and build a JSON data file capable of holding
recipe data. Use JavaScript to extract data from JSON data file and to
process and display the data in HTML format. In the second application, create a
an interactive application using PHP, Javascript, HTML, CSS and MySQL that allows a user
to build a customizable report based on recipe data stored on a web server.
